# Snake game

Snake game created using vanilla Javascript.

Idea follows one Scrimba course, but almost everything is changed to personal preference.

You can preview the page at: https://davorj94.github.io/snake-game/

Buttons are added for touch screens. Also, modal is added as closing screen, with additional information about score and option to restart the game.

Comments and images that are unused are if anyone decides to use real snake image (logic is added for image swapping based on snake movement).

Hope you like it, let me know if you think something should be optimized from your experience.
